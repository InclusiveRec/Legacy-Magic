#  Some thoughts on death magic:
#  Very dear trade-offs.  Health, negative status effects, etc can be traded for mana.
#  Rule number two, this stuff is hungry for mana.
#  Rule number three: where possible, make it scary

#  A scary, hungry spell:
#  Deathclaws
#  Claws of some sort snatch a player, paralyzing and damaging them.  Hold until caster's mana runs out
